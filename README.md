🎮 Game Overview

The project implements an interactive memory‑code game on the DE2 development board.
The user progresses through a series of states that control setup, play, evaluation, and result display.
All interactions use the board’s switches (SW), push‑buttons (KEY), HEX displays, and red LEDs (LEDR).
